# Proof study helper

Hi ! the goal of this project is to create a tool to prompt you with proposition to prove or generally test your knowledge and help you study.

The main feature is the rating system used to choose the next proof better than random.

## TODO/ideas

- [X] make a proof list selection fonction so that more than one proof list can be studied
- [X] update write_stats() fonction to make sure it still works if you add proofs to the list after the first time it is run
- [ ] add more demonstrations list
- [ ] make instructions on how to install and use
- [ ] improve the stat feature


# How to help
